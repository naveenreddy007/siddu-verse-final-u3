# Technical Architecture - AI Agent System

## System Overview

The AI Agent system is designed as a distributed, autonomous organization of specialized AI agents that work together to enhance the Siddu platform experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Registry
- Central registry of all active agents
- Health monitoring and status tracking
- Dynamic agent discovery and routing

### 2. Communication Layer
- gRPC-based inter-agent communication
- Event-driven user interaction protocols
- Message queuing and reliability guarantees

### 3. Safety & Monitoring
- Constitutional AI alignment checking
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
